              <p>
                In CMS, the SM processes are generated and simulated centrally, and we don't have to worry about them. But for a specific BSM search, a
                physicist has to take care of the BSM samples themselves, if they are not being handled already. For this section, I am using vector-like
                leptons as a reference BSM signal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03456" target="_blank">arXiv:1510.03556</a>. First, we need to integrate
                this new physics model to the existing standard model in an event generator like MadGraph. Typically, theorists share their BSM model in the
                Universal FeynRules Output (UFO) format, which contain automatized matrix-element generators. These files contain python modules which can be
                easily included as an extension to MadGraph. This allows us to play with the new particles and the Feynman rules associated with them. I have
                taken the latest VLL UFO file from the repository:
                <a href="https://github.com/prudhvibhattiprolu/VLL-UFOs" target="_blank">github.com/prudhvibhattiprolu</a>.
              </p>
              <p>This is the order of installation for this setup.</p>

                recent versions should also work fine. I recommend using conda to install everything. It's important that ROOT is build with the same Python
                version that is used here. For detailed instructions on how to handle Python environments and install ROOT properly, visit
                <a href="/mypages/fornoobs.html">here</a>.

                I would also recommend to keep all of these MC-generation tools inside the same directory. For me, the working directory is
                <code>/home/phazarik/mcgeneration</code>.

              <h3 id="local-madgraph">Setting up MadGraph, including the BSM models</h3>
              <p>
                MadGraph can be downloaded from the <a href="https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo" target="_blank">official website</a>. Building is not needed. The
                binary file is available at <code>mg5amcnlo/bin/mg5_aMC</code>. I have given the full path to MadGraph in my <code>.bashrc</code> file as
                follows.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush:shell">alias mg5="/home/phazarik/mcgeneration/mg5amcnlo/bin/mg5_aMC"</pre>
              <p>
                If you are not importing any BSM model, MadGraph setup is done. In case of any BSM model (like VLL in my case), the BSM models are unpacked into
                the MadGraph directory as follows.
              </p>

              </pre>
              <p>
                These model files in my example are compatible with MadGraph version v2 that was built on python2, but should also work with the latest MadGraph
                v3 that uses python3. In order to use MadGraph v3, these model files are made compatible with python3, and then imported into MadGraph as
                follows.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush:shell">

                PYTHIA is a program for simulating particle interactions as well as hadronization. It can be downloaded from the
                <a href="https://www.pythia.org/" target="_blank">official website</a>. Installation instructions are provided there. The following steps are
                used to install pythia with HepMC3 configuration. Make sure to <strong>give the full path to HepMC3</strong> during configuration. I am using
                version 8.312, but these instructions are valid for all versions.

                Hadronization happens in the <code>pythiaXXXX/examples</code> directory. That's why I have built pythia in my work-area for my convenience. But
                it can also be kept along with the other tools and export the output files to work-area for the next steps. Anyway, once pythia is build, I
                added the following paths to my <code>.bashrc</code> file, which is needed for C++ compilation of the hadronizer codes.

                In some of the examples, I have also seen PYTHIA used in a python based interface. For this, one can easily install PYTHIA and HepMC3 using
                conda-forge. But this is not important for the <a href="#toy">toy example</a> that I have shared in the next section. For a new user, I would
                not recommend this, because managing multiple versions of tools is messy.

                I also found a nice YouTube video on this Python based PYTHIA interface, which is a part of an

                be done with PYTHIA, starting from event generation.

                Delphes is a fast simulation framework for high-energy physics detectors. The Delphes outputs are equivalent to NanoAOD, but the information is
                structured differently in the ROOT files. It can be downloaded from the
                <a href="https://github.com/delphes/delphes" target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository. Installation instructions are available there as well.
                Building delphes is pretty straight forward.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush:shell">
                git clone https://github.com/delphes/delphes.git
                cd delphes
                make             # This takes a couple of minutes
              </pre>

              <h3>Wrapping up ... [optional]</h3>
              <p>
                In some examples, PYTHIA, HEPMC3 etc. can be used from the MadGraph interface itself (I'm exploring it, not an expert yet). For this, paths to
                PYTHIA and Delples should be included in MadGraph configuration. This has to be done once. I also added my fastjet setup, in case I need it
                later.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush:shell">
                set pythia8_path /home/phazarik/mcgeneration/pythia8312
                set delphes_path /home/phazarik/mcgeneration/delphes
                set fastjet /home/phazarik/fastjet-3.4.2/bin/fastjet-config          #optional
              </pre>
              <p>
                These paths are needed only when the hadronization etc is done inside MadGraph itself, by importing these modules. But in the
                <a href="#toy">toy example</a>, I am doing each step of the sample generation individually. These paths can also be added manually by editing
                the <code>input/mg5_configuration.txt</code> file in the MadGraph directory. Also, MadGraph may ask for something called <code>lhapdf</code>,
                which is a standard tool for evaluating parton distribution functions (PDFs). This can be installed using conda as follows.
              </p>

              <pre class="brush:shell">
                conda install -c conda-forge lhapdf
              </pre>

                The flowchart below illustrates the event simulation workflow I am going to use. The process begins with generation using MadGraph, where
                parton-level events are generated in the LHE format. The output LHE file is then fed into PYTHIA for hadronization, where partons are converted
                into physical hadrons, resulting in a DAT file. Finally, detector simulation is done using Delphes with a CMS card, which simulate how the CMS
                would record these events, producing a ROOT file that can be used for further analysis.

              <h3 id="toy-generation">Generation (QFT &rarr; LHE through MadGraph)</h3>
              <p>
                In the generation phase, tools like MadGraph are used to simulate hard scattering events based on quantum field theory. MadGraph takes in a
                process definition and a set of parameters from the run_card and param_card. The input file typically consists of these cards and configuration
                files, which define the physics process and the collider setup. The output of this phase is in the LHE format (Les Houches Event), a
                standardized text file that contains detailed information about the parton-level event, such as particle IDs, momenta, and event weights. The
                LHE file serves as the bridge to further event processing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let's try to generate a simple Drell-Yan process: pp &rarr; Z &rarr; ll. For this, be in your work area, go to MadGraph prompt, and define the
                process.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush:shell">
                mg5                       # my shortcut for opening MadGraph prompt.
                
                #Now inside MadGraph prompt.
                
                display particle          # displays all the available individual particles.

                exit
              </pre>
              <p>
                The <code>output</code> line creates a new directory containing the pp &rarr; Z &rarr; ll process, including the run-cards and param-cards etc.
                In principle, all of these can be done in a single step in the MadGraph prompt, but it's convenient to customize the parameters later. The cards
                are kept at <code>ppToZToLL/Cards</code>. Let's edit the <code>run_card.dat</code> file and change/add some important parameters as follows, and
                keep everything else as it is.
              </p>

              <p>
                The <code>ppToZToLL/bin</code> directory contains the binaries used to run the event generator, and <code>ppToZToLL/Events</code> contains the
                outputs for each run. Let's run a test and see what it does.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush:shell">

                The hadronization step happens in the <code>pythiaXXXX/examples</code> directory. For this, we need a code that reads the lhe file and
                hadronizes them, and edit <code>pythiaXXXX/examples/Makefile</code> to include this code so that it is compiled along with the rest of the
                staff.

                The <code>hadlhe.cc</code> file should be edited to give the correct path to the input LHE file that was generated using MadGraph, the number of
                events in the input file, and a desired output path for the <code>dat</code> file that contains the hadronized outputs. This
                <code>dat</code> file is later imported in Delphes for detector simulation. The hadronizer is executed as follows.

                So far, the whole MC production process is done step-by-step. First, event generation at the LHE level, then producing the hadronized gen-level
                information using PYTHIA, and then detector simulation using Delphes. This whole exercise is done for understanding what happens at the
                back-end. The hadronization step produces large dat files, which needs to be handled by Delphes before being useful. It turns out that this
                extra step can be avoided by merging the work of Delphes and PYTHIA, which is illustrated in the flowchart below.

              <p>
                I find it convenient because I don't have to go to the <code>pythia8312/examples</code> directory and create a mess there with all the temporary
                folders, and deal with the DAT files. However, this method complains about some missing libraries related to <code>ExRootAnalysis</code> at the
                beginning, and ROOT prompts some warnings about the same while loading the output files. But as long as we are not using those features, it's
                fine.

              <h3 id="lxplus-settingup">Setting up a CMSSW environment</h3>
              <p>
                First, setup a suitable environment in lxplus. For this example, I am going with <code>slc7_amb64_gcc700</code> which is compatible with
                <code>CMSSW_12_4_8</code>. This can be checked by running the following, and finding the right CMSSW version in the list.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush:shell">
                scram --arch slc7_amd64_gcc700 list CMSSW
              </pre>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, in this particular case, <code>lxplus7</code> is no longer maintained. So we need to use a singularity image OS by running the
                following right after logging into lxplus. More of this can be found here
                <a href="https://cms-sw.github.io/singularity.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush:shell">
                cmssw-el7
                echo $SCRAM_ARCH                        # This should display some slc7 architecture.
                export SCRAM_ARCH=slc7_amd64_gcc700     # This will pick the right architecture.
                echo $SCRAM_ARCH                        # Make sure that ou have the right architecture.
              </pre>
              <p>Now, go to a desired work-area (preferably in eos), create a CMSSW work area and select the environment.</p>
              <pre class="brush:shell">
                cmsrel CMSSW_12_4_8
                cd CMSSW_12_4_8/src
                cmsenv

              <p>
                I am going to demonstrate this using <code>CMSSW_12_4_8</code>. I logged into lxplus8 (with el8_amd64_gcc10 architecture). Inside
                <code>src</code>, I copied a gen-fragment template for Run2 Ultra Legacy, edited the gridpack location to put the locally available gridpack
                (produced with the same CMSSW release), and compiled the setup.
