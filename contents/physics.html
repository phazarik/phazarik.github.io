    <p class="w3-justify">My field of study is called Experimental Particle Physics. Before going to the <q>Experimental</q> part, I can give you a brief overview of the current state of particle physics. This is a field of study where we investigate what the universe is made up of. Our best understanding is encaptulated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank"><strong>Standard Model (SM)</strong></a>, which gives us a list of elementary particles and a set of rules which determine how they interact with each other.</p>

      <p class="w3-justify">The Standard Model particles are systematically organised in this nice table. Each of the entries is a fundamental particle which cannot be broken down into smaller sub-particles. In a nutshell, the violet and the green stuff in this diagram combine together in specific ways to form all the matter you see around you. (I apologize for the color-blind people.) In fact, only the first column <i>really</i> matters. Two <q>up</q> type quarks and a <q>down</q> type quark combine to form a proton, two down and a up quark form the neutron and so on. Together, these protons and neutrons form the nucleus of all the elements that we know. Atoms are basically bound states of these nucleus and the electrons. The neutrinos are something that we can't see so easily, but they are there too. The rest of the purple and green columns are just heavier cousins of the left-most ones! They form all sorts of exotic matter found in cosmic rays and high energy collisions. The rest of the fundamental particles in this list <q>carry</q> the different kinds of interactions between the matter-particles (like a messenger). For example, the photon, which is the particle-form of light, is responsible for the electro-magnetic force!</p>

  <p class="w3-container w3-content w3-justify">All of these particles have been discovered in experiments with reasonable confidence. These particles and their interactions are facts of nature. The SM is able to explain a wide range of natural phenomena across several orders of nagnitude, and it is our <strong>best understanding of nature</strong>. However, we have observed some phenomena that this model can't explain. People often try to modify this model and add new particles and new features to the list. All of these ideas are mathematically consistent. But how do you know they are true? That's where we come in.</p>
