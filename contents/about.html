      <p>Hi, I am Prachurjya Pran Hazarika, a grad-student from IISER Pune. I completed my masters in Physics from Tezpur Univesity in 2019. Currently I am working in the field of Experimental High Energy Physics under the supervision of <a href="http://sites.iiserpune.ac.in/~sdube/" target="_blank">Dr Sourabh Dube</a>. I am a member of the CMS collaboration at CERN, where we collide protons at extrememly high energies to see what matter is made up of. You may have heard about the famous <em>God Particle</em> before! It was the last missing piece from the <em>Standard Model</em> of elementary particles, which was discovered at CERN back in 2012. Now we are looking for more exotic particles which may explain some unanswered/unexplained phenomena.</p>

    <h3>Search for Physics Beyond the Standard Model in CMS Experiment</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">The Standard Model is currently the best-model for understanding the building blocks of nature. However, we still have to figure out a lot of unexplained phenomena. In my PhD, my main task is to design and implement analysis strategies to search for the evidence of the new theories <i>beyond</i> the Standard Model in the CMS experiment, CERN. A typical counting exeriment is done by properly estimating the collision events predicted by the Standard Model, and looking for excess events which may come from these new physics processes. Currently I am developing the analysis tools to search for the <em>vector-like lepton</em> in the Run-2 dataset (date taken from 2016 to 2018). I am helping my collague <a href="https://alaha999.github.io/OverwrittenMemories/" target="_blank">Arnab Laha</a> with this analysis and preparing myself for my own analysis in the near future. </p>

    <h3>Some service work for the CMS collaboration</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">I have been working with the EGamma group of CMS which is responsible for the reconstruction and identification of electrons and photons in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) of CMS. In 2021, I helped them out with a Neural Network based photon identification algorithm, which is currently being implemented in the Run-3 data taking period (2022 onwards). That is something I can brag about :D. I am also trying to figure out a way to develop a Deep Neural Network based super-clustering algorithm which can combine energy clusters deposited in the ECAL to reconstruct the original photon or electron which is responsible for these deposits.</p>
