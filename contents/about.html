      <p>Hi, I am Prachurjya Pran Hazarika, a grad-student from IISER Pune. I completed my masters in Physics from Tezpur Univesity and currently I am working on Experimental High Energy Physics under the supervision of <a href="http://sites.iiserpune.ac.in/~sdube/" target="_blank">Dr Sourabh Dube</a>. I am a member of the CMS collaboration at CERN, where we collide protons at extrememly high energies to see what matter is made up of. You may have heard about the famous <em>God Particle</em> before! It was the last missing piece from the <em>Standard Model</em> of elementary particles, which was dicovered at CERN back in 2012. Now we are looking for more exotic particles which may explain some unanswered/unexplained phenomena.</p>

    <h3>Search for Physics Beyond the Standard Model in CMS Experiment</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">Designing and implementing an analysis to search for the evidence of BSM in CMS experiment, CERN, by properly estimating the Standard Model background events and looking for excess events coming from new physics processes. Currently I am developing the analysis tools to search for the <em>vector-like lepton</em> in the Run-2 dataset (date taken from 2016 to 2018). I am helping my collague Arnab Laha (go check his <a href="https://alaha999.github.io/OverwrittenMemories/" target="_blank">website</a>!) and learning from him. </p>

    <h3>Some service work for the CMS collaboration</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">I have been working with the EGamma group of CMS which is responsible for the reconstruction and identification of electrons and photons in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) of CMS. In 2021, I helped them out with a Neural Network based photon identification algorithm, which is currently being implemented in the Run-3 data taking period (2022 onwards). That is something I can brag about :D. I am also trying to figure out a way to develop a Deep Neural Network based super-clustering algorithm which can combine energy clusters deposited in the ECAL to reconstruct the original photon or electron which is responsible for these deposits.</p>
