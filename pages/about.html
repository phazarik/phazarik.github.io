        Hi, I am Prachurjya Pran Hazarika, a grad-student from IISER Pune. I completed my masters in Physics from Tezpur Univesity in 2019. Currently I am working in the field of Experimental High Energy Physics under the supervision of Dr Sourabh Dube. I am a member of the CMS collaboration at CERN, where we collide protons at extrememly high energies to see what matter is made up of. You may have heard about the famous God Particle before! It was the last missing piece from the Standard Model of elementary particles, which was discovered at CERN back in 2012. Now we are looking for more exotic particles which may explain some unanswered/unexplained phenomena.

    <h2>Search for Physics Beyond the Standard Model in CMS Experiment</h2>
    <para>
      The Standard Model is currently the best-model for understanding the building blocks of nature. However, we still have to figure out a lot of unexplained phenomena. In my PhD, my main task is to design and implement analysis strategies to search for the evidence of the new theories beyond the Standard Model in the CMS experiment, CERN. A typical counting exeriment is done by properly estimating the collision events predicted by the Standard Model, and looking for excess events which may come from these new physics processes. Currently I am developing the analysis tools to search for the vector-like lepton in the Run-2 dataset (date taken from 2016 to 2018). I am helping my collague Arnab Laha with this analysis and preparing myself for my own analysis in the near future.

    <h2>Some service work for the CMS collaboration</h2>
    <para>
      I have been working with the EGamma group of CMS which is responsible for the reconstruction and identification of electrons and photons in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) of CMS. In 2021, I helped them out with a Neural Network based photon identification algorithm, which is currently being implemented in the Run-3 data taking period (2022 onwards). That is something I can brag about :D. I am also the contact person between EGamma and pdmv (Physics Data and Monte-Carlo Validation group).
